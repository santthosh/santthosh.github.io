I have been a native application developer (iOS, Android, Mac, .NET, Java) for some time now, high time I start focusing on web technologies, especially mobile web. I know what you are thinking, but here is my strategy

{% blockquote Winston Churchill %}
Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.
{% endblockquote %} 

This is going to be my play ground for web technologies, I'm going to share my thoughts all along the way, feel free to comment, shout out, scream, scold or make fun 

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<script>
			function helloWorldFunction() {
				alert("Hello World");
			}
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<button onClick="helloWorldFunction()">Try Me</button>
	</body>
</html>
```

Cheers, Santthosh
